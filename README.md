# False-Position-Method
The false position method is one of the finding root's methods. This method also called Regula Falsi method. This method has been implemented in Fortran 95 program. So, make sure you have the Fortran compiler already. The package has two files:
  1. falseposition.f95
  2. plot_falseposition.m (Matlab)
# How To Use?
You have to set three parameters input to run this program, for example:
  - Initial Boundary = -3
  - Finadl Boundary = 3
  - Data length = 100
 
An example, function of f(x) = x^2+2x+1 is used to find the root. As we know, from these function, the root is -1. You can input anything boundary values are, because the program has been written to find a root automatically.

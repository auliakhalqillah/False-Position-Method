# False-Position-Method
The false position method is one of the finding root's methods. This method also called Regula Falsi method. This method has been implemented in Fortran 95 program.
# Usage
There are three parameters input:
  - Initial Boundary = -3
  - Finadl Boundary = 3
  - Data length = 100
 
An example, function of ![f(x) = x^2+2x+1](https://i.upmath.me/svg/f(x)%20%3D%20x%5E2%2B2x%2B1) is used to find the root. As we know, from these function, the root is -1. You can input anything boundary values are, because the program has been written to find a root automatically.
